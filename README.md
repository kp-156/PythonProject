# PythonProject
I recreate some basic python projects with the help of several online tutorials.

1. A floating stopwatch window on Windows that stays on top of all other windows, making it ideal for timing tasks without interruption. The stopwatch can be easily started, paused, reset, and customized with a timer feature that accepts hours and minutes. It's a handy tool for productivity and time management.

Features:
> Floating stopwatch window that remains on top.
> Start, pause, and reset functionality.
> Set custom timers in hours and minutes.
> User-friendly graphical interface with tkinter.
> Compatible with Windows operating systems
